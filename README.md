# behave-multi-implementation-template
This is a template to create a Behave project with multiple implementations for a single Features definition.

Edit the `stage` parameter in `behave.ini` to change the implementation.
The template includes `cartas` and `tablero` stages for demonstration purposes.

Run `behave` in the command line to test it. The output will depend on the selected `stage`.
